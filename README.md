# HotwordSynth
Use TTS to create synthetic audio data for hotword detection

Poor mans way to get audio samples for a specific hotword.
This uses different free linux TTS systems to generate a range of audio 
samples for hotword detection. 

Don't expect this to work very well in production, as due to the limited 
number of voices and low variety this tends to overfit quickly
